# Code the flexible Python IRC Bot

Code is a open source python IRC bot. Code can run on any operating system that supports Python 2.7, but works best on Linux based distributions.

Feel free to test Code here: http://byteirc.org/channel/L

## Features

Code is packed full of features ranging from raw IRC functions to modules that can be loaded and unloaded with ease. Some features include:

#### Control panel
Code has a built-in control panel that you can enable, that also serves as a webserver and REST API that allows you to remotely execute functions or retrieve information from the bot via GET/POST requests. Everything is authenticated, too!

#### The control panel itself:

#### Mute feature (also shutdown, reboot, etc):

#### Fast & lightweight
Code is very small, so even with the extensive amount of features it has, it should run as little as possible.

#### Modules
Code uses modules for all of its commands and features. These modules can be loaded, unload, completely removed, and dynamically updated to fit the channels needs. Modules can be made easily, and because of the nature of the modules, you can make whatever you want/control the bot easily.

#### Very user friendly
It is very easy to install and run Code, even if you have no knowledge of running an IRC bot. I created the bot so it has either no external modules, or the modules are packaged with it. The included 'help' commands provide specific documentation for almost every command. Try `.help <command>`

#### Easy to use API
When creating your own modules, it is always very easy to have easy to understand functions and a documented API. Note the API isn't fully documented; there are a lot of features that aren't listed there. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/lrstanley/Code/wiki) for more information.

#### Open-Source
Found a bug, have an idea for a feature, or need technical support/advice? You can always navigate to the [Github](https://github.com/lrstanley/Code/issues) page to make requests and post bugs. Heck, even fork Code and make your own modifications!

#### Configuration
Nearly every single aspect of the bot is configurable for your liking. Don't like a module? Remove it. Like only ONE module? Whitelist it!

## Installation - How do I install? 

**If you have any issues during the install, feel free to head to http://chat.liamstanley.io/ to get help**

Unix & Unix-like OS: 
--------------------

    apt-get install python2.7 git screen
    git clone https://github.com/lrstanley/Code.git
    cp -rf example.json config.json
    nano config.json
    python code.py

If you choose to not run your bot in the foreground, you may use the `screen` daemon, like so:

    screen -S code python code.py

This creates a terminal window that can be logged into and out without disturbing the process in that window. To exit screen safely, hit `CTRL+A` then `CTRL+D`.
To log back into, and view the playback of Code, type `screen -x code`.

Windows: 
--------------------


- Make sure you have Python installed `http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/`
- Download Code here: `https://github.com/lrstanley/Code/zipball/master` and unzip it.
- Copy and rename `example.json` to `config.json` (Note, it's best NOT to use the Windows notepad, rather, use Notepad++)
- You can open up command prompt, `cd` to Codes directory, and execute Code with `python code.py`.
- Note, if command prompt says that `python` is not a internal or external command/program, that means Python failed to be added to your system-wide %PATH% file. So, you need to add it to the %PATH% variable.
