.IX Item "Can't interchange noncharacter code point U+%X in position %u"
(W utf8, nonchar) Noncharacters are code points that are permanently reserved 
in the Unicode Standard for internal use. They are forbidden for use in open 
interchange of Unicode text data. Noncharacters consist of the values U+nFFFE 
and U+nFFFF (where n is from 0 to 10^16) and the values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.

.IX Item "Can't represent surrogate code point U+%X in position %u"
(W utf8, surrogate) Surrogate code points are designated only for surrogate code 
units in the \s-1UTF\-16\s0 character encoding form. Surrogates consist of code points 
in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF.

.SH "COMPARISON"
.IX Header "COMPARISON"
Here is a summary of features for comparison with Encode's \s-1UTF\-8\s0 implementation:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Simple \s-1API\s0 which makes use of Perl's standard warning categories.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Recognizes all noncharacters regardless of Perl version
.IP "\(bu" 4
Implements Unicode's recommended practice for using U+FFFD.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Better diagnostics in warning messages
.IP "\(bu" 4
Detects and reports inconsistency in Perl's internal representation of 
wide characters (UTF-X)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Preserves taintedness of decoded \f(CW$octets\fR or encoded \f(CW$string\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
Better performance ~ 600% \- 1200% (\s-1JA:\s0 600%, \s-1AR:\s0 700%, \s-1SV:\s0 900%, \s-1EN:\s0 1200%, 
see benchmarks directory in git repository)
.SH "CONFORMANCE"
.IX Header "CONFORMANCE"
It's the author's belief that this \s-1UTF\-8\s0 implementation is conformant with 
the Unicode Standard Version 6.0. Any deviations from the Unicode Standard 
is to be considered a bug.
