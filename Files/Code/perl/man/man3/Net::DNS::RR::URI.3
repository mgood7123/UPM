.SH "NAME"
Net::DNS::RR::URI \- DNS URI resource record
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    use Net::DNS;
\&    $rr = new Net::DNS::RR(\*(Aqname URI priority weight target\*(Aq);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Class for \s-1DNS\s0 Service (\s-1URI\s0) resource records.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented
by the type-specific methods defined in this package.
.PP
Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data
structures is discouraged and could result in program termination or
other unpredictable behaviour.
.SS "priority"
.IX Subsection "priority"
.Vb 2
\&    $priority = $rr\->priority;
\&    $rr\->priority( $priority );
.Ve
.PP
The priority of the target \s-1URI\s0 in this \s-1RR.\s0
The range of this number is 0\-65535.
A client \s-1MUST\s0 attempt to contact the \s-1URI\s0 with the lowest-numbered
priority it can reach; weighted selection being used to distribute
load across targets with equal priority.
.SS "weight"
.IX Subsection "weight"
.Vb 2
\&    $weight = $rr\->weight;
\&    $rr\->weight( $weight );
.Ve
.PP
A server selection mechanism. The weight field specifies a relative
weight for entries with the same priority.  Larger weights \s-1SHOULD\s0 be
given a proportionately higher probability of being selected.  The
range of this number is 0\-65535.
.SS "target"
.IX Subsection "target"
.Vb 2
\&    $target = $rr\->target;
\&    $rr\->target( $target );
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1URI\s0 of the target. Resolution of the \s-1URI\s0 is according to the
definitions for the Scheme of the \s-1URI.\s0
