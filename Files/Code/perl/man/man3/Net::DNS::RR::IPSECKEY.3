.SH "NAME"
Net::DNS::RR::IPSECKEY \- DNS IPSECKEY resource record
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    use Net::DNS;
\&    $rr = new Net::DNS::RR(\*(Aqname IPSECKEY precedence gatetype algorithm gateway key\*(Aq);
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1DNS IPSEC\s0 Key Storage (\s-1IPSECKEY\s0) resource records.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented
by the type-specific methods defined in this package.
.PP
Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data
structures is discouraged and could result in program termination or
other unpredictable behaviour.
.SS "precedence"
.IX Subsection "precedence"
.Vb 2
\&    $precedence = $rr\->precedence;
\&    $rr\->precedence( $precedence );
.Ve
.PP
This is an 8\-bit precedence for this record.  Gateways listed in
\&\s-1IPSECKEY\s0 records with lower precedence are to be attempted first.
.SS "gatetype"
.IX Subsection "gatetype"
.Vb 1
\&    $gatetype = $rr\->gatetype;
.Ve
.PP
The gateway type field indicates the format of the information that is
stored in the gateway field.
.SS "algorithm"
.IX Subsection "algorithm"
.Vb 2
\&    $algorithm = $rr\->algorithm;
\&    $rr\->algorithm( $algorithm );
.Ve
.PP
The algorithm type field identifies the public keys cryptographic
algorithm and determines the format of the public key field.
.SS "gateway"
.IX Subsection "gateway"
.Vb 2
\&    $gateway = $rr\->gateway;
\&    $rr\->gateway( $gateway );
.Ve
.PP
The gateway field indicates a gateway to which an IPsec tunnel may be
created in order to reach the entity named by this resource record.
.SS "pubkey"
.IX Subsection "pubkey"
.SS "key"
.IX Subsection "key"
.Vb 2
\&    $key = $rr\->key;
\&    $rr\->key( $key );
.Ve
.PP
Base64 representation of the optional public key block for the resource record.
.SS "keybin"
.IX Subsection "keybin"
.Vb 2
\&    $keybin = $rr\->keybin;
\&    $rr\->keybin( $keybin );
.Ve
.PP
Binary representation of the public key block for the resource record.
