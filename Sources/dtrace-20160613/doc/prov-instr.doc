The 'instr' provider is similar to the FBT provider, but provides
the ability to instrument probes on various interesting instructions
in the kernel, specifically jump instructions. This can be used to
monitor control flow and look for exceptional or common scenarios when
trying to understand what happens dynamically in the kernel.
