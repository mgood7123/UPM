C code test/example of a USDT. Just make and run - and it should show
up in the 'dtrace -l' list.

Run ../../build/simple-c from the usdt/c directory. (We need
to adjust the LD_LIBRARY_PATH searching, so at the moment, run it
from here).

This will simply display something like:

...
PID:1290 52: here on line 25: crc=000083cf
PID:1290 here on line 27
PID:1290 here on line 29
PID:1290 here on line 31
PID:1290 53: here on line 25: crc=000083cf
PID:1290 here on line 27
PID:1290 here on line 29
PID:1290 here on line 31
...

If a dtrace probe is placed on this process' probe, then you
will see the crc change, indicating a breakpoint got placed.

A test, might be to use gdb to place a breakpoint at the same place
as the usdt and see what happens. (Dtrace will assume it belongs
to it, whilst the process is running).

The script, mkapple, shows that Apple does something a little 
easier for dtrace generation. They have modified the compiler and/or
linker to auto generate the .SUNW_dof section without needing to
directly invoke dtrace to post process the ELF file.
