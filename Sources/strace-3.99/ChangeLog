	* util.c (umovestr) [LINUX]: Handle Linux like SunOS4

Fri May 31 01:48:49 1996  J. Richard Sladkey  <jrs@world.std.com>

	* version.c: Version 3.1 is released.

Thu May 23 01:04:43 1996  J. Richard Sladkey  <jrs@world.std.com>

	* aclocal.m4 (AC_DECL_SYS_ERRLIST): Try looking in stdio.h
	as well since that's where glibc declares it.  Go figure.
	* signal.c (sys_sigreturn) [ALPHA]: Use sigcontext
	instead of sigcontext_struct since glibc v5+ apparently
	plays games with the native OS namespace.
	From David Mosberger-Tang <davidm@AZStarNet.com>.

Mon May 20 23:17:14 1996  J. Richard Sladkey  <jrs@world.std.com>

	* desc.c (decode_select, sys_select, sys_oldselect) [LINUX]:
 	Handle old and new styles of argument passing for select on Linux.
	* ioctl.c, stream.c: Conditionalize stream code on presence of
	sys/stream.h instead of poll because glibc implements poll but
	not the rest of the stream interface.
	* signal.c [LINUX]: Standardize on the name sigcontext_struct.
	(sys_sigprocmask) [ALPHA]: Handle OSF flavor which is more like
	sigsetmask.
	* term.c (term_ioctl): Use _VMIN, if present, for TC{G,S}ETA*.
	* util.c (umoven, umovestr): Move data in long-sized chunks
	at a time, instead of hard coding it to be 4.

	* Makefile.in: Remove dependencies and rules relating to files
 	normally found in the os directory.  Because of the new scheme we
 	don't know precisely where they come from.  Sigh.
	* signalent.sh: Make it work for sunos4, linux, and svr4.
	* {sunos4,linux{,/alpha},svr4}/Makefile.in: Make rules correspond
 	to traditional make syntax.  Add signalent.h to files which can
 	unconditionally be rebuilt.  Prevent signalent.h from being
 	unconditionally being rebuilt since it's customized.
	* {sunos4,linux{,/alpha},svr4}/{ioctlent,errnoent,signalent}.h:
 	Use versions built by {ioctlent,errnoent,signaltent}.sh.
  	* sunos4/ioctlent.sh: Work around sprintf troubles with SunOS

	* defs.h (tprintf): Fix typo in non-gcc ansi prototype for tprintf.
	Reported by Thanh Ma <tma@encore.com>.

	* strace.c (cleanup): Send SIGCONT before SIGTERM because Linux
	1.1.62 doesn't continue a traced child when the parent exits.
	Reported by Matt Day <mday@artisoft.com>.

	* file.c [SVR4]: Include sys/cred.h.
	(access_flags): Update access flags for SGI.
	(sprinttime): Change type of sprinttime argument from unsigned
	long to time_t.
	* process.c [HAVE_PRCTL]: Include sys/prctl.h.
	[HAVE_PRCTL] (prctl_options, sys_prctl): New for SGI.
	(printsiginfo): Conditionally compile SI_TIMER and SI_MESGQ.
	Cast si_band member to long before printing.
	* signal.c (sigact_flags): Add _SA_BSDCALL for SGI.
	(sigprocmaskcmds): Add SIG_SETMASK32 for SGI.
	* strace.c [SVR4] [MIPS]:
	(foobar): New dummy signal handler.
	(main): Install a dummy signal handler in the child before pausing
	to work around an SGI bug in PRSABORT.
	(proc_open): Send a interrupt to the child instead of aborting the
	syscall which doesn't work on Irix5.2.
	* svr4/dummy.h: Add new unfinished SGI syscalls
	(e.g. sys_sysmp, sys_sginap, etc.).  Handle some SGI syscalls like
	existing calls (e.g. sys_ksigaction like sys_sigaction).
	Printargs does the print thing for sys_sethostid.
	* svr4/syscall.h: Declare all new SGI syscalls.
	(SGI_KLUDGE): Define syscall table starting index to be 1 for SGI
	and add it to all subcall entry points.
	(SYS_pgrpsys_subcall, SYS_sigcall_subcall, SYS_context): Don't
	decode as subcalls on MIPS. Instead, use the normal syscalls.
