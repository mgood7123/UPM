This is the unmodified README from Branko Lankester's release of strace
for Linux.  Some of the notes and instructions are no longer valid
however the file has been retained for its historical value. -- jrs
========================================================================

This is the second release of strace for linux, it requires linux
version 0.99.10 or newer.  strace was written by Paul Kranenburg for
SunOS, I have modified it to work with linux.  Read the file README and
the strace.1 for more info on strace.


Changes for this release are:
- bugfixes
- support for new system calls and ioctls
- symbolic output for: termio ioctls, sysv ipc, fcntl file locking,
  statfs and ptrace
- microsecond time stamps

A lot of the changes and bugfixes for this version were done by
Rick Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com>, System V IPC support was added
by Ulrich Pegelow <pegelow@moorea.uni-muenster.de>.


FILES:

README.first	this file
README		the original readme file for SunOS strace
getioctls	script to create the ioctlents.h file for linux.
Sun/*		files from the original package I didn't use


Notes:

- With older versions of Linux (before 0.99.10) signals can get lost
for a traced process.

- strace works best if you have a proc fs mounted on /proc, the
/proc/##/mem frame buffers are used for reading system call arguments.
You can use /dev/ram or some other unused block device for mounting
the proc fs:

	mount -t proc /dev/ram /proc

or in /etc/fstab:

/dev/hda	/proc		proc	defaults
